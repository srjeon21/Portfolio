                        <p>Give Orange Inc. is a non-profit fundraising organization, consisting of Korean international students in US. Give Orange Boston is an active branch, with members from Korean students in Boston. Every year, it selects one beneficiary to raise money for, which ultimately becomes the identity of that year. <br>
                           The responsibility as a visual production team member is to produce card news to post on Giv.O Boston’s official Instagram Page. The goal is to spread the idea of donation throughout society. Although designs are made individually, for every draft, members give feedback via Slack. Then the drafts are revised, and all members view them again. Therefore, the process as a whole is communicative and collaborative.

                        <p>Yearbook was a collection of pages made by students, which are to reflect upon that academic year’s events and memories.<br>
                            Adobe Photoshop was used for building much of the graphics. Idea and styles of graphics were based on the topic of the page, as well as the overall theme. For instance, neon frames were made for the year when the theme was “Neon Lights.”
                            Drafted graphics were moved onto InDesign and prudently placed, following the CRAP design principle.

                            Over the summer, I wanted to serve my family meals every week or so. I turned this into a personal project where I film the process and produce a video to record my memory.<br>
                            Videos were filmed using my phones, and they were edited using Premiere Pro. Graphics at the beginning and the mascot were drawn in Photoshop. The mascot resembles my appearance, and the intro displays the mascot as a pancake art.<br>
                            The YouTube channel ‘SaIlYo’ is an abbreviation of ‘Cooking for My Parents For 4 Months’ in Korean.

                                    Korea International School Jeju was accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The accreditation is a six-year cycle, and 2020 was when the accreditation at KISJ needed to be renewed. To promote the school to WASC representatives, the school held a school poster contest.<br>
                                    Navy blue and yellow were the school’s colors, and DRAGONS were its values. My poster received the most votes from students and the administrations. Therefore, since then, this poster is hung everywhere around the campus.

                                    Self-studied Figma to build the wireframe of SERIN TO SHINE portfolio. The main page consists of important information, such as About Me, Education, Activities, and Contact Information. It also contains a visual that reflects the owner’s computer skills. The Figma wireframe contains several animations, like the blurring of the image when it hovers.<br>
                                    The wireframe reflects the evolvement of the overall design by keeping different versions. I continued to think about how to make the design better, which made me more considerable in UI and UX.

                            I revisited Figma to build the wireframe of Dongwon Internal Medicine Clinic Webpage. I was able to review and practice Figma's features like components and auto layout.<br>
                            My mom has not been using the clinic's logo for a long time, so she didn't have the logo file with her anymore. Therefore, referring to what she could recall of her original logo, I rebuilt it for her using Adobe Illustrator. It was my first time to solely rely on Illustrator, and this was a great chance for me to practice.
